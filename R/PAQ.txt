<p class="Body" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><em><span style="font-size: 20.0pt;">Physical Activity</span></em></p>

<p>Move!... for better health. The CDC says "Regular physical activity is important for all people; age, ethnicity, shape or size do not matter.&nbsp; Everyone can gain from the health benefits of physical activity."&nbsp; Moving our bodies, like eating smart, is important for our health.&nbsp; If we eat lots of veggies, fruit and other healthy foods and get a moderate amount of exercise we have done much of what we should do to be healthy and this includes being fit if we want to get pregnant or to become a father. If a woman gets pregnant and goes to term with the pregnancy, being fit before she gets pregnant will help her physically and emotionally through the pregnancy and into motherhood.&nbsp; Whether we plan on getting pregnant or never getting pregnant, being in good physical and emotional condition is where we all want to be. It does not take much time or effort to move enough to enjoy the benefits of being physically fit.&nbsp; Check with your doctor before starting a new exercise routine, especially if you have any health concerns.</p>
