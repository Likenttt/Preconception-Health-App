<p><strong>1. The term </strong><strong>"intimate partner violence</strong><strong>"</strong><strong> is used more now than </strong><strong>"domestic violence.</strong><strong>"</strong><strong>&nbsp; Can you give a reason for the change in terms?</strong></p>

<p>Intimate partner violence (or abuse) includes a wider range of offenders than the term "domestic violence." Also, "abuse" is used because some of the abuse offences are not physical violence.&nbsp; Intimate partner violence perpetrators include individuals close to the victim, but not necessarily present or former sexual partners.&nbsp; Click below for the description of the difference in the terms.</p>

<p><strong>3. What is </strong><strong>"</strong><strong>financial abuse?</strong><strong>"</strong><strong> Can you give one example? Can you give a reason why this would make it difficult for someone to leave an abuser?</strong></p>

<p>We need money to pay rent, food, clothing, health care, etc.&nbsp; Financial control becomes a weapon of the abuser to control the victim.&nbsp; If the victim does not have a debit card, check book or cash, this becomes a serious obstacle for leaving the abusive relationship.</p>

<p>True.&nbsp; A pregnancy is not the cure for intimate partner violence.&nbsp; Even in the minority of cases where violence is less during the pregnancy, violence usually continues at the previous intensity or worse after the birth.&nbsp; Sometimes domestic violence begins and increases during pregnancy and it is more likely to happen with younger women and if the pregnancy is unintended.</p>

<p><strong>13. Who is responsible for preventing sexual assault? Men or Women?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Men are the vast majority of sexual assault offenders.&nbsp; For sexual consent, 'yes' means 'yes.' &nbsp;The absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes'. &nbsp;A California law to prevent sexual assault states that&nbsp;yes means yes. It says that silence or lack of resistance does not constitute consent. Someone who is drunk, drugged, unconscious or asleep cannot grant consent. &nbsp;If you are a man, please show this link to another man and discuss it.&nbsp; Educating men to not sexually assault is the job of men.&nbsp; Bonus points if you are a male that shares this with a male.&nbsp; Click below to see on how men can prevent themselves from sexually assaulting women.</p>
