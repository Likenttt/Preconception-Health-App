<p>There is no health without mental health. Mental health is as important as physical health in fact the two are closely linked.&nbsp; Mental illness can worsen many diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular (heart) disease, asthma and obesity. Mental health is a key to good health and is very important for good preconception health.&nbsp; The lack of good living situations such as adequate housing, safe neighborhoods, good jobs and wages, quality education and access to quality health care also contribute to poor health.&nbsp; Also, these adverse living conditions are compounded by the long term effects of racism and sexism.</p>

<p><strong>9. Is your body image positive or negative?&nbsp;</strong></p>
9}
<p>If your answer is "negative" you are not alone.&nbsp; Many women in the United States feel pressured to measure up to a certain social and cultural ideal of attractiveness which can lead to poor body image.&nbsp; Women are constantly bombarded with Barbie-Doll-like images and men, the dude with the washboard abs.&nbsp; By presenting an ideal that is so difficult to achieve and maintain, the cosmetic and diet industries are assured of growth and profits.&nbsp; It is no accident that youth and thinness are increasingly promoted as an essential criterion for beauty. The message we're hearing is either 'all women need to lose weight' or that the natural aging process is a disastrous fate.&nbsp; If you would like to have a free, confidential conversation with a counselor at the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), call 800-931-2237 Mon-Thu 9am to 9pm,&nbsp; Fri 9am to 5pm ET for guidance, information and resources in your community.&nbsp; Check out&nbsp; the NEDA website, proud2bme.&nbsp; You can also search for referrals online.</p>

<p><strong>10. Can you think of or imagine a community project that could have a positive influence on a person with a mental illness and at the same time, helps solve other community health problems?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are many things that can be done to create positive community outcomes by putting two or more individuals or groups together.&nbsp; The product of this "mutualistic" (good for all) relationship can be a positive boost of health for all parties and also for the community.&nbsp; For example, Connections: Health and Wellness Advocacy, a mental health agency in Cleveland, Ohio has started Urban Goodness, an urban farm on the grounds of an agency serving women in an area of city that struggles with access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n Urban Goodness has provided at least 20 people with a unique opportunity to learn marketable job skills with hands-on farm-related work despite the fact that they suffer from severe mental illnesses.&nbsp; The program benefits the inner-city neighborhood in which it is located by providing fresh produce, and it plans to promote home food gardens in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The urban farm is located on the grounds of the Hitchcock Center for Women, a substance abuse intervention agency which is another player in this positive partnership.&nbsp; Goodness grows!&nbsp; This is a Win-Win-Win for the individuals with a mental illness, the women of the Women's Center and the neighborhood people with a positive result for the city of Cleveland!&nbsp; Look for opportunities to create or be part of smart, mutually beneficial projects.&nbsp; Check out "More Info" for Connections and Urban Goodness.</p>
