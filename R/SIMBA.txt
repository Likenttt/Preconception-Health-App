<p>This section is about sexual health and behavior, intimate relationships and equality between women and men in the joys of sex.&nbsp; It's also about the making of a reproductive life plan.&nbsp; A life plan includes your goals and deciding if and when a child would be part of your life. WHY bother with a life plan?&nbsp; Having a plan may help you avoid an unintended pregnancy as well as sexually transmitted infections.&nbsp; The plan can also help you actively prepare yourself for a wanted pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unplanned pregnancies are more likely to lead to problems with the pregnancy, the birth and the health of the mother and baby.&nbsp; Planning is important!</p>

<p><strong>1. What is a Reproductive Life Plan?</strong></p>

<p>A Reproductive Life Plan is thinking about having or not having children and how that fits in with your other life goals.&nbsp; Now is a good time to do a reproductive plan.&nbsp; This plan will change because life is unpredictable, but planning now will keep you behind the wheel as you travel through life.&nbsp; If you do not want to get pregnant now or in the near future, you need to be using a method of birth control before engaging in vaginal intercourse. Here are a few tips for making a plan. *Do you plan to have any children? *If you think you want to have a child, when? *If you have a child, how much time do you plan before the next pregnancy?&nbsp; *What are you doing or plan on doing to prevent a pregnancy?&nbsp; *Are you planning on being in good health at the time you get pregnant and not just when you find out you are pregnant?&nbsp; *How will a pregnancy affect everything else in your life? <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/reproductiveplan.html" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a> for more ideas on how to make a reproductive life plan.</p>

<p><strong>5. Which of the following would you consider to be a "good birth result" or a "good birth outcome?"<p><strong>

<li><strong>a.) A live birth</strong></li>
<li><strong>b.) A healthy baby born with no birth defects</strong></li>
<li><strong>c.) A baby born at a healthy birth weight (not too light)</strong></li>

<li><strong>a.) 6 months to 18 months</strong></li>
<li><strong>b.) 18 months to 24 months</strong></li>


<p>b.) 18-24 months. Birth spacing of less than 12 months has a statistically higher risk of autism. Birth spacing of less than 18 months has a higher risk of a low birth weight baby, a small baby and/or a baby born too soon. The shorter birth spacing does not give the mother a chance to recover from physical and possibly emotional stress. Most experts recommend two years between pregnancies and agree that three to five years is best.&nbsp; The spacing of pregnancies depends on your personal goals and situation.&nbsp; Also, if you are confused as how long to wait between pregnancies, talk to your gynecologist and see what she or he recommends based on your health.&nbsp; Birth spacing of more than 5 years has problems too.&nbsp; Click on the link below for info from the Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p><strong>26. How does </strong><strong>"pulling out</strong><strong>"</strong><strong> or </strong><strong>"withdrawal</strong><strong>"</strong><strong> rate as a method of birth control?</strong></p>

<p>Withdrawal is a method of birth control that is 96% effective when used perfectly with every act of vaginal intercourse and 73% of the time when not used perfectly.&nbsp; Withdrawal does not protect either partner from sexually transmitted infections and it requires self-control and trust that the man will pull out before he ejaculates or "comes." Withdrawal is always available and free and is good back up to other methods of birth control.&nbsp; The man must pee after coming to flush out the sperm in the penis if another round of intercourse is on the menu. The pulling out method is not recommended for teens.&nbsp; Practice makes perfect so if you want to use pulling out as a method of birth control, practice a bunch of times using a condom.&nbsp; For more information and video on withdrawal.</p>

<p><strong>34. Is masturbation, or self-pleasuring, a safe sexual activity?</strong></p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; Masturbation is when females or males touch their own genitals for sexual arousal and pleasure, usually to the point of orgasm (sexual climax).&nbsp; If masturbating alone, a person cannot give her/himself an infection, nor get herself pregnant.&nbsp; It is done by touching, stroking, or massaging their own clitoris or penis until an orgasm happens. Some women and men use "sex toys." Sex toys should be washed before being shared with another to avoid infection.&nbsp; Also, mutual masturbation (mutual touching of another) is considered a safer sexual activity (outercourse) as long as sexual fluids are not swapped.&nbsp; Click on the link below for a clever, funny one minute video on "Masturbation".</p>

<p>Yes, statistically, 70% of all women do not regularly or ever have an orgasm with vaginal intercourse, even though most men do.&nbsp; In fact, sex is often over as soon as the man has had his orgasm! On the other hand, foreplay ("be"fore play) can become the "main" play.&nbsp; Foreplay has been given a new name "outercourse", so intercourse is not necessarily expected after.&nbsp; Outercourse is safer than vaginal intercourse and can be sexually satisfying for both women and men.&nbsp; "Safer" means that there is much less of a chance of an unplanned pregnancy or infections.</p>

<p><strong>36. What is </strong><strong>"</strong><strong>outercourse</strong><strong>"</strong><strong> anyway?</strong></p>

<p>You might think of "outercourse" as "fore-play" continued to become the "main-play," without intercourse happening.&nbsp; With the sexual body fluids not being swapped "inside" the partner, there is no chance of pregnancy and less chance of infection.&nbsp; Outercouse is "safer sex." Avoid having any semen go onto the vulva.&nbsp; There is a slight chance some of those little guys can swim their way into the vagina and a pregnancy and/or infection can happen.&nbsp; A barrier method of protection must be used with any oral sex.&nbsp; Outercourse needs to be planned.&nbsp; Talk about it before you get down together.&nbsp; Go to "More Info" for all the advantages of outercourse!</p>

<p><strong>39. How can using a male or internal condom make sex more pleasurable?</strong></p>

<p>A condom tends to lengthen the time the male maintains his erection and therefore gives more time for him and his partner to experience the pleasure of sexual contact.&nbsp; The woman is more likely to experience an orgasm and the extended time period of excitement can make for a more pleasurable orgasms for both the woman and the man. Condoms are very effective at preventing pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and HIV when used CORRECTLY, EVERY time, and ALL the time through oral, anal and vaginal intercourse.</p>
