<p>Environmental Exposures to Toxic Substances The "environment" is everything around us, indoors and outdoors.&nbsp; The air we breathe, the water we drink, the ground we walk on, and the food we eat are all part of the environment.&nbsp; Chemicals and other substances in the environment are often toxic and can cause serious health problems such as cancer, heart and lung disease and reproductive and pregnancy problems. We can be affected by these harmful substances if we breathe them in, taste, eat, drink or touch them.&nbsp; Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are at a higher risk of having a poor birth result if they are exposed to these substances.&nbsp; We need to know what the toxins are so we can do our best to prevent their use and our exposure to them.</p>

<p><strong>1. Whose health is hurt more by toxic substances? Adult's or Children's</strong>?</p>

<p>Children are more vulnerable.&nbsp; Developing fetuses, infants, children, pre-teens and teenagers are all especially vulnerable.&nbsp; Being exposed to even small amounts of toxic substances during important times of development can lead to death or disease early in life, later in life, or even across generations.&nbsp; Exposure to environmental toxic substances can harm the reproductive systems of females and males.&nbsp; Avoiding these toxic materials is important, especially before and during pregnancy.&nbsp; Go to "More Info" on protecting ourselves and our families from toxic substances.&nbsp; Check out "Toxic Matters".</p>

<p><strong>4. Mercury is a toxic, hazardous metal that has a damaging effect on the brain and nervous system of developing fetuses and young children.&nbsp; In which of the following foods is this toxin found?</strong></p>

<li><strong>a.) Vegetables</strong></li>
<li><strong<b.) Popcorn</strong></li>
<li><strong>c.) Some fish and shellfish.</strong></li>

<p>c.) Some fish and shellfish contain high levels of mercury that may harm a fetus or a young child's brain and nervous system. The risk from mercury depends on the amount of fish and the type of fish eaten. The fish NOT TO EAT are shark, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, swordfish, tile fish, and tuna (bigeye and ahi) and any local fresh or saltwater fish that are posted with a warning.&nbsp; Go to "More Info" on fish safer to eat.</p>

<p><strong>6. Is salmon a good fish to eat?&nbsp; Yes or No?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Yes and No. Wild salmon is a good fish to eat.&nbsp; Industrial farm raised salmon, though low in mercury, has high levels of PCP's, dioxins and other contaminants.&nbsp; Also, farm raised salmon are fed antibiotics and coloring to make their flesh more appetizing.&nbsp; Girls and women should avoid farmed salmon because of the effects of these contaminants which tend to stay in the body.&nbsp; They could affect a possible pregnancy and the quality of their breast milk.&nbsp; If you do eat farmed salmon, do not eat the skin which has most of the toxins.</p>

<p><strong>11. Do you know a way to prevent toxoplasmosis, an infection that can cause serious pregnancy complications?</strong></p>

<p>Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a microscopic parasite.&nbsp; This is an infection that may not have any symptoms for the pregnant woman, but can cause serious eye or brain damage for the infant or health problems for the child later on.&nbsp; Infection can occur when: *Eating raw or undercooked meat or unwashed fruits and vegetables. *Touching cat poop. *Touching pets that are rodents, like mice, hamsters and guinea pigs.&nbsp; Rodents carry the virus LCMV, that can harm your pregnancy. *Touching kitchen utensils and cutting boards used to prepare raw or undercooked meat. *Touching dirt or sand.&nbsp; So use gloves and wash your hands with soap.

<p><strong>17. What is a chemical that is found in many plastic water bottles and liners of canned foods and other products that disrupts our natural hormone (endocrine) system and can harm fetal development?</strong></p>

<p>BPA (bisphenol A) is an endocrine disruptor that may disrupt fetal development.&nbsp; Recent evidence shows that BPA may cause miscarriage, obesity and diabetes in children.&nbsp; The National Toxicology Program has stated "some concern about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children." Also, BPA "may affect the development of the male reproductive system."&nbsp; To reduce exposure, avoid all plastic bottles that have the recycle code 3, 6, or 7 and canned goods that have a plastic inner liner.&nbsp; Do not put plastic containers in a microwave oven or put hot food or drink in them.&nbsp; There is still debate on the use of plastic containers that may be considered "safe". So use glass or BPA-free metal containers as much as you can.</p>
