<p>People with a health care provider are more likely to have better health. Having a primary care provider (a family physician or nurse practitioner) is especially important. 
A primary care provider can develop meaningful and sustained relationships with their patients.  Having a primary care provider increases the chances that illness is prevented. 
Also, a primary care provider can detect early warning signs and if disease is detected earlier, it is more likely at a curable or treatable stage. We all need a primary care provider, 
whether or not you are female or male, want to get pregnant now, later or never.  If you want to know more about health insurance with the Affordable Care Act ("Health Care Reform")

<p><strong>11. Should we get vaccinated against infections? Yes or No?</strong><br></p>

<p>Yes. Vaccines prevent many infections.&nbsp; Disease prevention is the key to public health.
It is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it.&nbsp; Vaccines can prevent disease 
for both the people who receive the vaccine and those with whom they come in contact. This 
is also true for a pregnant woman protecting the health of her pregnancy or a woman who may 
get pregnant. Vaccines are responsible for the control of many infectious diseases that 
were once common in this country and around the world.&nbsp; Over the years, vaccines have 
saved millions of lives. Go to the Center for Disease Control "CDC-INFO" for a link to free 
downloadable or hard copy health publications or call <a href="tel:+1800-232-4636">800-232-4636</a>. Click the link below for common questions about vaccinations.</p>

<p><strong>13. Should children and teenagers be vaccinated to</strong><br></p>

<p>Yes. Young people are in close proximity to their peers in school and in college.&nbsp; This closeness is a situation where infections can and do spread quickly.&nbsp; The meningococcal vaccine protects against meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord) which can lead to serious problems, including death.&nbsp; The HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine protects against cervical cancer and genital warts and the Tdap vaccine protects against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.&nbsp; Your health care provider will determine which of the recommended vaccines you may need.&nbsp; If you are not yet 18 years old and have not had your vaccinations, you might want to share this link with your parents or guardian.</p>

<p><strong>14. Where can you get more information on why vaccinations are recommended by virtually all medical and public health organizations?</strong><br></p>

<p><strong>15. Should women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant soon be vaccinated?</strong><br></p>

<p>Yes, but some vaccinations should not be given to pregnant women, such as those that use a live vaccine such as MMR 
(mumps and measles, rubella) and varicella/chickenpox.&nbsp; A Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccination is 
recommended during pregnancy because the immune response is transferred to the fetus so after birth the vulnerable infant 
is protected from the serious and potentially life threatening consequences of whooping cough (pertussis). Have any questions? 
Talk to your health care provider or you can call toll free <a href="tel:+1800-232-4636">800-232-4636</a>.</p>

<p><strong>17. At what age is the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine recommended for both females and males?</strong></p>

<li><strong>a.) 11 - 26 years old</strong></li>
<li><strong>b.) 18 - 26 years old</strong></li>
<li><strong>c.) 21 - 26 years old</strong><br></li>

<p>a.) 11 - 26 years old for females and males. HPV infection causes genital warts, most cervical cancers and other 
cancers to females and males. HPV infection can also cause problems with a pregnancy. The CDC states that "For the 
HPV vaccine to work best, it is important for preteens to get all three doses (shots) long before any sexual activity with 
another person begins. It is possible to be infected with HPV the very first time they have sexual contact with another 
person.&nbsp; Also, the vaccine produces higher antibodies that fight infection when begun at this age compared to later." 
If you are under 18 years old and have not been vaccinated, you may want to share this information with your parent(s) or guardian(s).
Since not all health care providers offer the HPV vaccine, mention to your provider your interest in the vaccine.&nbsp; If your 
health care provider does not offer the HPV vaccine, ask for a referral.&nbsp; You can also call your county health department, federal 
community health center or Planned Parenthood Health Center at <a href="tel:+1800-230-PLAN">800-230-PLAN</a>. Medicaid covers HPV vaccines and immunizations 
for eligible individuals under 21. Health Care Reform has made HPV vaccinations free as part of ACA's preventative services. 
In case you are expected to pay for the vaccine and cannot afford it and are 19 or over, contact either of the two vaccine 
manufacturers for free vaccine. &nbsp;For the vaccine, Cervarix, call GlaxoSmithKline's Vaccine Access Program at <a href="tel:+1877-822-2911">877-822-2911</a> and for Gardasil, 
call Merck's Vaccine Patient Assistance Program at <a href="tel:+1800-293-3881">800-293-3881</a>.</p>

<p><strong>18. Which daily supplement is recommended if you are sexually active?</strong><br></p>

<p>A daily multivitamin, or a single supplement with 400 mcg of folic acid, is recommended if you are sexually active.&nbsp; Taking a daily multivitamin BEFORE getting pregnant will increase the odds of having a good birth result.&nbsp; Folic acid, which is in most multivitamins, helps protect a fetus from spinal cord defects and a baby from autism.&nbsp; If you ever become pregnant, and go to term, you will be encouraged by your medical practitioner to take a prenatal vitamin which has higher amounts of certain vitamins and minerals, including folic acid.</p>
