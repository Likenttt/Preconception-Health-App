<p>Environmental Exposures to Toxic Substances The "environment" is everything around us, indoors and outdoors.&nbsp; The air we breathe, the water we drink, the ground we walk on, and the food we eat are all part of the environment.&nbsp; Chemicals and other substances in the environment are often toxic and can cause serious health problems such as cancer, heart and lung disease and reproductive and pregnancy problems. We can be affected by these harmful substances if we breathe them in, taste, eat, drink or touch them.&nbsp; Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are at a higher risk of having a poor birth result if they are exposed to these substances.&nbsp; We need to know what the toxins are so we can do our best to prevent their use and our exposure to them.</p>
