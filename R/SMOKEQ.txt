<p>Smoking SUCKS big time! Every year in the US around 400,000 people die from tobacco related disease, making it the leading cause of preventable death.&nbsp; And 50,000 people die from second hand smoke.&nbsp; More deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than all deaths from AIDS, illegal drug use, alcohol use, car accidents, suicides and murders. Tragically, each day thousands of young people still pick up cigarettes for the first time.&nbsp; It is much harder to quit if a smoker starts before age 20.&nbsp; Don't start.&nbsp; If you smoke, quitting is the best and likely the toughest thing you can ever do.</p>

<p><strong>11. Are e-cigarettes a safer alternative to regular cigarettes? Yes, No or it depends?&nbsp;</strong></p>
11}
<p>It depends.&nbsp; Much more research needs to be done on the health effects of e-cigarettes.&nbsp; Stay tuned.&nbsp; Stanton Glantz, MD., a leading tobacco control expert, states that: "If smokers switched entirely from regular cigarettes to e-cigarettes, if no one started smoking because of e-cigarettes and if e-cigarettes did not discourage quitting, smokers would be better off."&nbsp; Nicotine and other substances in e-cigarettes can harm a pregnancy. Someone pregnant should not use any "nicotine delivery device." If sexually active and not using birth control, a woman should not e-smoke because they may well get pregnant and endanger her pregnancy.&nbsp; Stay away from "second hand vapor" from e-cigarettes. Liquid nicotine has been found to be toxic if ingested or put or spilled on the skin.&nbsp; Keep liquid nicotine secure and away from children.&nbsp; Search "liquid nicotine toxicity."&nbsp; Click below if you want to stay tuned to Dr. Glantz with his University of California blog on tobacco and e-cigarettes.</p>
