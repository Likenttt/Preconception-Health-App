<p>Alcohol is the most common cause of liver failure and other serious health problems, like cancer, for adults.&nbsp; Alcohol can cause miscarriage, still birth and a huge list of lifelong problems for a child.&nbsp; These are known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).&nbsp; It is critically important for a woman to stop drinking alcohol before she becomes pregnant and not drink all the way through her pregnancy. Alcohol is involved in half of all deadly car accidents, a majority of sexually transmitted infections and most cases of domestic violence. Women have a lower tolerance than men to the negative effects of alcohol.&nbsp; Refuse to be a passenger in a car when you know the driver has been drinking or is impaired with any substance.&nbsp; Of course, do not drink and then drive.&nbsp; Make sure everyone uses their seatbelt and the driver is not texting or talking on the cell phone or doing anything else but driving.</p>
