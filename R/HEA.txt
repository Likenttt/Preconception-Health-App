<p class="Body" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><em><span style="font-size: 20.0pt;"><b>Healthy Eating</b><br>
What we eat and how much we move count big time. If 'we are what we eat' and 'use it or lose it' are true, then it may be worth our while to look 
at what food turns us on and how much we move our bodies. Eating smarter with enough physical activity will help us be healthier.  
If we choose to bring another person into this world, we will be a healthier mother (or father) from the moment conception happens.  
Having a healthier lifestyle before, during, and after the pregnancy will leave us physically and mentally stronger for the tough and 
rewarding job of being a parent.  We and our kids will be much better off for our effort.</span></em></p>

<p><strong>1. Do you know a reason why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (</strong><strong>"Food Stamp Program</strong><strong>") is important for the health of millions of Americans?</strong><br></p>

<p>The federal SNAP program provides food for hungry Americans.&nbsp; Hunger is obviously a health problem for the people who do not have enough food. 
Hunger is also a risk factor for a woman who gets pregnant while hungry and/or goes through her pregnancy and delivery hungry. This is a recipe for a poor 
birth outcome and for a hungry child. This problem continues in the United States with millions of children among the victims of hunger in the United States. 
There should be no stigma attached to hunger.&nbsp; Food is a life need for all.&nbsp; Americans who manage to have SNAP assistance can now buy local food 
from farmer's markets. Call<a href="tel:+1800-221-5689">800-221-5689</a> if you want to know the location of your local SNAP office. If you or someone you 
know needs to know the eligibility rules for SNAP and instructions on how to apply for food assistance Click the link below.</p>

<p><strong>15. Would you and your family prefer to consume food with less pesticide residue, antibiotics and hormones?</strong><br></p>

<p>If yes, buy, trade or grow your own organic food. Food grown organically maybe labeled "certified organic." Many small organic growers do not become certified organic because of the expense. Know your local growers and determine if they use organic methods. Some likely do. Go to <a href = "www.localharvest.com"> www.localharvest.com</a>.  Check out your farmer’s market. Meat, dairy and eggs can also be raised organically. Healthy bacterial colonies, such as in the gut, lead to a healthier immune system which can boast reproductive health.  Antibiotics, whether as medication, in food or in personal care products like hand soap, can disturb these important, healthy bacteria and can contribute to poor birth outcomes.  Check out "More Info" for Mayo Clinic's view on the differences between organically grown food and food that is "conventionally" grown with the use of chemicals.</p>
